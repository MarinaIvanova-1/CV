## Marina Ivanova, PhD

I am currently a student at Makers academy learning full-stack software development. I have a background in research having spent the last ten years 
doing experiments in the lab and contributing to scientific developments that make the world a better place. 

I decided recently it was time to take up a new career challenge and software development seemed like a perfect choice. This career allows me to apply 
my analytical mindset and excellent problem solving skills in a new environment. 

I am a dynamic, ambitious and friendly person. I work equally well collaboratively or individually. I am  looking for a role in which I can develop myself as a Full-stack software engineer. 

## Projects - to be updated

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Final project**            | A webapp to do x. | React, Jest, etc. |
| **Something else worked on** | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |


## Skills

Excellent communicator

During my career in academia I excelled at communicating my work to a wide variety of audiences. I have published seven research papers in 
leading scientific journals, I have presented results of my research at an international meeting in front of 200 scientists, I have 
routinely prepared written and oral reports summarising my findings. I have experience communicating complicated scientific concepts 
to non-scientists and I am comfortable using whatever communication tool is necessary to convey my point.  

Problem solving

I pride myself on my ability to problem solve. I believe my experience tackling big scientific questions and my ability to break 
down complicated problems into smaller more achievable tasks will help me to become a great software developer.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD

- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Your University / College (start_date to end_date)

- Subject, any specialisms
- Grade
- Other cool stuff

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
