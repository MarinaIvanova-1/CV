## Marina Ivanova, PhD

I am currently a student at Makers Academy learning full-stack software development. I have a background in scientific research, having spent the last 10 years doing experiments in the lab and contributing to developments that make the world a better place. 

I decided recently it was time to take up a new career challenge and software development seemed like the perfect choice. This career will allow me to apply my analytical mindset and excellent problem-solving skills in a new environment. 

I am a dynamic, ambitious and friendly person and I work equally well collaboratively or individually. I am looking for a role in which I can develop myself as a Full-stack software engineer.

## Skills

Excellent communicator

During my career in academia, I excelled at communicating my work to a wide variety of audiences. I have published seven research papers in 
leading scientific journals and have presented results of my research at an international meeting in front of 200 scientists. I have 
routinely prepared written and oral reports summarising my findings. I have experience communicating complicated scientific concepts 
to non-scientists, and I am comfortable using whatever communication tool is necessary to convey my point.  

Problem-solving

I pride myself on my ability to problem-solve. I believe my experience tackling big scientific questions and my ability to break 
down complicated problems into smaller, more achievable tasks will help me to become a great software developer.
