## Marina Ivanova, PhD

LINKS - to be filled in

I am a junior software engineer recently graduated from Makers Academy. I have a background in scientific research, having spent the last 10 years doing experiments in the lab and contributing to developments that make the world a better place. 

I decided recently it was time to take up a new career challenge and software development seemed like the perfect choice. This career will allow me to apply my analytical mindset and excellent problem-solving skills in a new environment. I am a dynamic, ambitious and friendly person and I work equally well collaboratively or individually. I am looking for a role in which I can develop myself as a Full-stack software engineer.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my career in academia, I excelled at communicating my work to a wide variety of audiences. I have published seven research papers in 
leading scientific journals and have presented results of my research at an international meeting in front of 200 scientists. I have 
routinely prepared written and oral reports summarising my findings. I have experience communicating complicated scientific concepts 
to non-scientists, and I am comfortable using whatever communication tool is necessary to convey my point. These skills have helped me a lot to make pairing and team projects as productive and as enjoyable as possible. 

#### Problem-solving

I pride myself on my ability to problem-solve. I believe my experience tackling big scientific questions and my ability to break 
down complicated problems into smaller, more achievable tasks will help me to become a great software developer.

#### Learning and teaching

I am passionate about constantly learning and developing myself, did XYZ learning.. Mentor at Makers, supervised a PhD student

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2022 to November 2022)
During 16-week full-time bootcamp I learnt the best practices of software development such as object-proented design, test-driven development, pair programming and others. We learnt such technologies as (to be filled)
I was awarded a scholarship from the Department of Education that covered 100% of the tuition fees.

#### PhD, University College London 
Specialisation: Cancer biology, biochemistry and structural biology
Doing PhD allowed me to develop myself as a logical thinker, determined to solve the hardest problems related to cancer developmet.
I won two scholarships, one from Cancer Research UK and one from UCL, which covered my all four years of my tuition fees and living expenses.

#### Specialist (equivalent to BSc followed by MSc), Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia
Diploma with Honours (GPA 4.8 out of 5)
Specialisation: Biochemistry

## Work Experience

**Imperial College London** (October 2020 to October 2022)  
Postdoctoral Researcher

During this position I split my time between two projects:
 - studying how a cell duplicates its genetic information prior to cell division
 - how a cell packs its DNA inside its nucleus

**Birkbeck College** (June 2017 to September 2020)  
Postdoctoral researcher

My project focused on studying how human immune T-cells kill virally infected or cancerously transformed cells.

**The Francis Crick Institute** (September 2012 to May 2017)  
PhD student

My project focused on studying cell polarity - why some cells are different on one side than the other and how misregulation of this process can lead to cancer development and progression.

## Hobbies

I love to travel, try new food and play tennis.
